Docker has been something that I've always learned in pieces or completely strayed away from. I know that probably doesn't sound right, but to sum that all up, I never fully learned Docker because it scared me. Why? Well, for 1) It seemed too complicated, and 2) I never fully understood its benefits. Now, my hands are all tied and I ultimately need to know about Docker and stop running from it, otherwise I'll never progress as an engineer a GoFundMe. While there are MANY things I need to be more comfortable and understanding of in order to do my job well, Docker (and Kubernetes) is where I would like to start. Finally about to get over this hurdle and know more about this technology. 

My goal is to study this enough to reach a point where I can regurgitate it to someone who has no clue what this is and it makes sense to them. That's how I know I understand it in its entirety.
